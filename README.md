Hello People! 

My name is Emilio Cortina, I like cars and racing. For the past few years my Dad and I have been restoring a 1986 Jeep Comanche pickup to its former glory, and we recently got it to look almost like it did 34 years ago when it rolled off the assembly line. 
My favorite type of music is Metal and my top three favorite bands/artists are Avengened Sevenfold, Metallica, and Ozzy Osbourne. 
My favorite video games are BattleField 1 and 5
